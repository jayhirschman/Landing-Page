                        Jase Mathews, a rising star at PHS, the globe’s most prestigious and largest accounting firm, is on the cusp of making partner.  His latest assignment, the high stakes audit of the colossal Sharp Industries, is his golden ticket.  As Jase meticulously dissects Sharp Industries financial processes, unsettling anomalies emerge and with the help of a few trusted allies, Jase begins to unravel inconsistencies that stretch far beyond simple bookkeeping errors.  What they uncover lurking within Sharp Industries’ ledgers is a tangled web of deceit so vast that it threatens to destabilize not just the company, but the very foundation of the world’s economy.  Could the deceit run deeper than Sharp Industries itself?  Could Jase’s own esteemed firm, PHS, be complicit in the deception?
Torn between his loyalty to PHS and the looming threat of worldwide financial collapse, Jase must decide who to trust and how far he is willing to go to expose a truth that could unravel everything.  
Can Jase expose the truth and hold the guilty accountable or will the web of deceit be too much for one lone auditor to handle?

                        Leo Mathews has just achieved his dream of becoming a partner at Boone & Harper (B&H) , a large national accounting firm, and his first engagement as the sole signing partner for attestation reports on Enterprise Nexus's Cloud ERP product, PMS, seems like the perfect start. Riding high on his career success, Leo is ready to make a name for himself as a leader in the world of IT audit.
But as Leo delves deeper into the audit, he begins to uncover troubling connections between B&H, Enterprise Nexus, and customers using PMS. The more he investigates, the more he realizes that the relationships are not as straightforward as they seem.
With his career and reputation on the line, Leo must navigate a web of deceit and hidden agendas. His most trusted mentor, the person he thought he could always rely on, may not be who she appears to be. As the stakes rise, Leo faces a critical choice: uncover the truth and risk everything, or turn a blind eye and protect his newfound status.
In A Glitch in the Cloud, Jay Hirschman weaves a gripping tale of ambition, betrayal, and the relentless pursuit of truth in the high-stakes world of IT audit.
